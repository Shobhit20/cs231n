In order to get the codes to produce the desired output one must run the get_datasets.sh file in the datasets folder.
To run the script locate the file via terminal & type "./get_datasets.sh"

The following libraries would be needed (install them as root user):
1) Pip - "sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential" followed by "sudo pip install --upgrade pip" 
2) jupyter notebook and its dependecies(ipython, ipython-kernel etc.) - "pip get install jupyter"(native pip)
3) numpy - "pip install numpy"(native pip)
4) scipy - "pip install scipy"(native pip)
5) matplotlib - "pip install matplotlib"(native pip)

** No need to do step 1 on a windows machine
On a windows machine try installing the packages like scipy and numpy via a whl file else the installation might cause troubles
The link for the whl files is given below :
"http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/"

Download and in the location of the file type - pip install "filename.whl" in the command prompt
